## Maximum Flow
1. Fattest path. Given an edge-weighted digraph and two vertices ss and tt, design an ElogE algorithm to find a fattest path from s to t. The bottleneck capacity of a path is the minimum weight of an edge on the path. A fattest path is a path such that no other path has a higher bottleneck capacity.

   sort all edges in descending order, begin with a graph with only s and t, add one edge at a time to the graph successively, check whether s and t are connected, repeat until connected. As for how to check connectivity:using quick union
   
2. Perfect matchings in k-regular bipartite graphs. Suppose that there are n men and n women at a dance and that each man knows exactly k women and each woman knows exactly k men (and relationships are mutual). Show that it is always possible to arrange a dance so that each man and woman are matched with someone they know.

   build a graph with source s connected to n men, which is connected the n women they know respectively, all the women are connected to t,  and compute the maxflow as shown in the job seeker example in lecture.

3. Maximum weight closure problem. A subset of vertices S in a digraph is closed if there are no edges pointing from S to a vertex outside S. Given a digraph with weights (positive or negative) on the vertices, find a closed subset of vertices of maximum total weight.

   elaboration:  
   As Picard (1976) showed, a maximum-weight closure may be obtained from G by solving a maximum flow problem on a graph H constructed from G by adding to it two additional vertices s and t. For each vertex v with positive weight in G, the augmented graph H contains an edge from s to v with capacity equal to the weight of v, and for each vertex v with negative weight in G, the augmented graph H contains an edge from v to t whose capacity is the negation of the weight of v. All of the edges in G are given infinite capacity in H.  
   A minimum cut separating s from t in this graph cannot have any edges of G passing in the forward direction across the cut: a cut with such an edge would have infinite capacity and would not be minimum. Therefore, the set of vertices on the same side of the cut as s automatically forms a closure C. [**because it does not have an edge point to other vertices outside the set, whose capacity is infinity**] The capacity of the cut equals the weight of all positive-weight vertices minus the weight of the vertices in C [**why? as we know, the capacity of a cut(A,B) equals the sum of the flows on its edges from A to B minus the sum of the flows on its edges from from B to A, in this situtation, the edges that cross the cut can only be the subset of edges pointed from s or pointed to t, since other edges have weight of infinity, for every positive-weight vertex v, it is connected to s with some edge e by definition, if v is not at the same side of s,e crosses the cut, by maxflow property "A = set of vertices connected to s by an undirected path with no full forward or empty backward edges", e is full forward edge, it should contribute to the capacity of the cut, else v is at the same side of s, the edge (s,v) will not cross the cut and therefore does not contribute to the capacity, for every negative-weight vertex v, it is connected to t, similarly as above, if it is at the same side of s, the edge e from v to t is full forward and will contribute to the capacity of cut, else is unconcerned, therefore the mincut would be sum of the weights of positive-weight vertices at the side of t and the negative weights of negative-weight vertices at the side of s**] , which is minimized when the weight of C is maximized. By the max-flow min-cut theorem, a minimum cut, and the optimal closure derived from it, can be found by solving a maximum flow problem.
   
## Radix Sorts 
1. 2-sum. Given an array a of n 64-bit integers and a target value T, determine whether there are two distinct integers i and j such that a_i + a_j =T. Your algorithm should run in linear time in the worst case.

   radix sort the array, and begin with the first index i and last index j, if ai+aj<T, increment i, else decrement j
   
2. American flag sort. Given an array of nn objects with integer keys between 0 and Râˆ’1, design a linear-time algorithm to rearrange them in ascending order. Use extra space at most proportional to R.   

   radix sort
   
3. Cyclic rotations. Two strings ss and tt are cyclic rotations of one another if they have the same length and ss consists of a suffix of tt followed by a prefix of tt. For example, "suffixsort" and "sortsuffix" are cyclic rotations.  
   Given nn distinct strings, each of length LL, design an algorithm to determine whether there exists a pair of distinct strings that are cyclic rotations of one another. For example, the following list of n = 12n=12 strings of length L = 10L=10 contains exactly one pair of strings ("suffixsort" and "sortsuffix") that are cyclic rotations of one another.

   The order of growth of the running time should be nL^2 (or better) in the worst case. Assume that the alphabet size R is a small constant. Signing bonus. Do it in nL time in the worst case.  
   
   define a hash function for string such that two strings have same hash value iff they are cyclic rotations. Approach: let the hash value of a string s be the sum of hashcode of all possible cyclic rotations of s. Finally use a hashset to check.
